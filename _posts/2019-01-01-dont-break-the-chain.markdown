Try to add a new link to a chain everyday and don't break the chain.

{% highlight ruby %}
# A chain is initialized here
$chain = []

# Add a link to the chain
def add(link)
  $chain.push(link)
end

# Define a job to execute every day
job_type :add_link_to_the_chain, '/usr/local/bin/add_link_to_the_chain :task :fun_level'

every :day
  # you can choose taking action or do nothing
  if action == "yes"
    add("X")
  else
    add(" ")
  end
end

puts($chain.join(""))
# The result as you see the chain is not broken if you take action everyday
# XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
{% endhighlight %}
