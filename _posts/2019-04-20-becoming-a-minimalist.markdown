# Problem
Every morning I wake up then be so frustrated with my messed-up house (life). Day-to-day, I have bought [many things](/tools/#devices) which I barely use. I have heard about minimalism before, it's awesome, cool but I never think about trying it.

# Plan
**Objectives:**
- Reduce number of things which I don't need
- Control purchase intention (which save me a lot of money and much time)

**Processes:**
- List up everything I own
- Sell things which I don't use
- Set budget limit for buying things (only buy things which I really need such as drink and food)

# Do
...(doing)

# Check
- [ ] How many things I have now?

# Adjust
- (continue)
